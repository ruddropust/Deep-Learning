    "\n",
    "The number of learnable parameters in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) depends on several factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kernel Size (K)**:\n",
    "    - The size of the convolutional filter (e.g., 3x3, 5x5).\n",
    "    - Larger kernels have more parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Number of Input Channels (C_in)**:\n",
    "    - The depth of the input volume (e.g., 3 for RGB images).\n",
    "    - More input channels increase the number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Number of Output Channels (C_out)**:\n",
    "    - The number of filters or feature maps produced by the convolutional layer.\n",
    "    - More output channels result in more parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bias Term**:\n",
    "    - Each filter has an associated bias term.\n",
    "    - Adding bias increases the number of parameters by the number of output channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fully Connected Layers**:\n",
    "    - The number of neurons in the input and output layers.\n",
    "    - More neurons lead to more parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Network Depth**:\n",
    "    - The number of layers in the network.\n",
    "    - Deeper networks generally have more parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Pooling Layers**:\n",
    "    - Pooling layers do not have learnable parameters but affect the input size of subsequent layers.\n",

    "Understanding these factors helps in designing efficient CNN architectures with the desired number of learnable parameters.\n"
