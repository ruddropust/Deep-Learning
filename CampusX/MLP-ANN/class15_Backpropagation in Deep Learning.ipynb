    "Backpropagation is one of the important concepts of a neural network. Our task is to classify our data best. For this, we have to update the weights of parameter and bias, but how can we do that in a deep neural network? In the linear regression model, we use gradient descent to optimize the parameter. Similarly here we also use gradient descent algorithm using Backpropagation."
