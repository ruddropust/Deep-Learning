    "### Dropout Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "A Dropout layer is a regularization technique used in neural networks to prevent overfitting. During training, it randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero at each update step, which helps to break up happenstance patterns that are not generalizable. This forces the network to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Keras, a Dropout layer can be added to a model as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from keras.layers import Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "model.add(Dropout(rate=0.5))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `rate` is the fraction of the input units to drop, which is typically set between 0.2 and 0.5.\n"
